**Summary**: The provider contract documents how hello-wasm meets all four requirements from hello-web. The contract is validated by wasmtime tests that confirm Component Model format and greeter interface behavior. The WIT interface signature is the stable API boundary, with semver-based versioning for any breaking changes.
